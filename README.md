# Character Shrinker
This is an experiment on using a HuffmanTree to encode characters more efficiently.
It does this by searching through a document to find the most used characters, then
encodes these using a HuffmanTree. More popular characters will be encoded as smaller values,
with the goal of minimizing total size needed to represent the encoded document.
