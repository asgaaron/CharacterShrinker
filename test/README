Steps to test your Huffman Tree implementation.

1. Make a directory for this assignment.

2. Implement all your java programs in this directory.

3. Compile all your java files: 
   javac *.java

4. Copy all files from the directory below to your assignment directory
   
   cp /home/faculty/jhyeh/cs321/labs/lab4/files/test/* ./.
  
5. To run the test program, execute the following on the command line

   ./run_test_Huffman.sh <fileBuildHuffman> <fileToEncode>
   
   for example:
   ./run_test_Huffman.sh fileBuildHuffman.txt fileToEncodeSmall.txt

6. After running the previous command, if nothing prints out on the screen, 
   then the test did not detect any error in your HuffmanTest output.
